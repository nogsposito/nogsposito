# Hello, World! 🌍

My name is Vinicius Spósito, i'm 18 years old and a computer science student enrolled in [Cesar School's](cesar.school) Computer Science course. I'm currently located in Brazil (Recife) and **i'm actively seeking job and internship opportunities for my growth in the technology field. I'm very flexible, dedicated, and willing to learn and work.**

I've had extense coding experiences with the **languages C, C++, Python, JavaScript and the framework Django.** However, i'm more than open to learn new technologies for job opportunities. I've spent one year living in Minnesota, United States, **so i'm fluent in english and flexible for international opportunities. I'm specially interested in opportunities involving Data Science, Machine-Learning and Back-End engineering, but i remain open to any other oportunities.**

So far, you can check some public repositories i own or collaborated to pinned in my profile; such as [TECMO](https://github.com/Caldas42/TECMO), in which me and partners from college built **a toy using Arduino and C++**, or the [Receitopédia](https://github.com/Caldas42/Receitopedia) in which we developed a recipe-storing application or the [RegistraElas](https://github.com/nogsposito/Projetos2-Cesar) in which we developed a job registers manageament application stored by a **Whatsapp Chatbot for a real client, both in which we used Django; alongside Python, HTML, CSS and having deployed in Azure.**
