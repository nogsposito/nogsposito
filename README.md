### English Version

# Hello, World!

My name is Vinicius SpÃ³sito, i'm 18 year old and a computer science student enrolled in [Cesar School's](cesar.school) Computer Science course. I'm currently located in Brazil (Recife) and **i'm actively seeking job opportunities for my growth in the technology field. I'm very flexible, dedicated, and willing to learn and work.**

I've had extense coding experiences with the **languages C, Python, JavaScript and the framework Django.** However, i'm more than open to learn new technologies for job opportunities. I've spent one year living in the United States, so i'm fluent in english and flexible for international opportunities.

So far, you can check some public repositories i own or contributed to pinned in my profile; such as [TECMO](https://github.com/Caldas42/TECMO), in which me and partners from college built a toy using Arduino and C++, or the [ReceitopÃ©dia](https://github.com/Caldas42/Receitopedia) in which we developed a recipe-storing application or the [FÃ¡brica de Ideias](https://github.com/nogsposito/Projetos2-Cesar) in which we developed a job registers manageament application, both in which we used Django; alongside Python, HTML, CSS and having deployed in Azure.z
